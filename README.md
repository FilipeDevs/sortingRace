# Sorting Race

This Java project was developed for one of my courses at HE2B-ESI.

The project serves as a tool to visualize and compare the complexity and performance of two distinct sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Merge Sort.

The architecture used is MVC.

Users have the ability to select the size of the array they wish to sort, specify the number of threads to be utilized, and choose the algorithm to be employed.

## Usage (Maven)

**Please ensure you have maven installed on your machine**

1. Move to the root of the project :

```
cd SortingRace
```

2. Compile the project :

```
mvn compile
```

3. Run the project (javafx) :

```
mvn javafx:run
```
